# Bitcoin: The Freedom to Transact

August 15, 1971, marks the complete loss of fundamental day-to-day freedom for humanity, the <b>freedom to transact</b>.
Some elite corporations decided everybody else in the world should respect the dollar as a sole authority over everybody's
freedom to transact, of course with your countries' fiat currencies as sidekicks.
This was the drift of the dollar away from the gold standard.
Today most people do not believe the dollar(or any other fiat currency) has no other value other than human <b>trust</b>, 
that's why corporations print more paper at <b>zero cost on energy</b> and hyperinflate the society with non-valuable bills.

Everyone who want to transact using their paper has to follow more unnecessary rules followed by ruthless terms and conditions.
In a non-dollar country, they require you to have a dollar denominated account to easily follow every transaction executed
on their <b>permissioned</b> network. Without permission from a central entity you cannot do anything with fiat currency, even with more than enough
balance.

## The Good, the Bad, the Ugly and the Greater

### The Good
Communication is key to transacting, the paper (fiat money) came in as way to enhance communication between transacting parties and 
reduce the load and costs of moving around with such heavier and valuable money as gold and silver.

Digital information technology solved this problem even more smoothly. Parties do not need physical presence of any participant
in a transaction for the merchandise to succeed. The speed at which a transaction is completed increased exponentially, the costs(fees)
decreased reasonably. 

### The Bad, the Ugly
Corporations built digital financial platforms to allow people transact smoothly. At this time, it is good to remember that 
these elite corporations have already forced everybody in the world to use the dollar. So, the networks they built were based
on the same ideas of mass control. They built centralized, permissioned networks.

#### Centralization
Every transaction has to be submitted to the corporation before getting to the receiving party. All the transaction history
is stored and controlled by the corporation that owns the network. This exposes the information to potential mutability, which
makes it easy to reverse transactions and to create value at zero cost on energy.

#### Permissioned
Every transaction has to be permitted by the corporation. This why you need to submit too much paper work and personal details
to join the network. There is no privacy in using these kind of networks. Transactions are subject to surveillance.
Any transaction can be rejected if it breaks any of the rules set by and favorable to the elite few. They can change the
protocol without any input from users. Simply, you have to beg to transact.

### The Greater
January 03, 2009, comes Satoshi Nakamoto with fire stolen from the gods. They did not just stole the fire, they made it hard for
any corporation to stole it back or quench it once in the hands of men. Bitcoin is the fire unstolable and unquenchable by the gods.
It is a financial network based on arnachy. 

Bitcoin does not have a leader or any central figure, transaction history can be
written and read by any participant on the network as long as they agree to follow the protocol rules favorable
to everyone on earth apart from the elites whose goal is to trample all humanity down. Transaction data is immutable on the network, meaning any transaction is irreversible.

Those who write the transaction history are called miners, a miner is chosen by providing their proof of work to fellow miners, this is a proof that they have solved a very
difficult problem on the network at that time. Solving the difficult problem requires compute power, an expense on energy. This is the <b>cost on energy</b> that is stored as value in bitcoins.
Anyone can become a miner without submitting any paper work or personal details to any
corporation.
By the way, anyone can just read the data without need for any permission, using blockchain explorers, bitcoin wallets or other tools.

To join the Bitcoin network, you do not need any paper work or to surrender personal details to anybody. Anyone can create a
wallet using secp256k1 mathematics or using wallet providers software for non-technical users.
Transactions can be executed by anyone from any point in space and time. 
Transactions are peer-to-peer, no central party controls the flow of value from one individual to the other. Payments go straight to the receiving party
Nobody begs to anybody to transact. The success of the transaction is permissionless, depends on the fees you choose
to pay a miner to include your transaction on their block space.

This is by far, one of the greatest innovation of the information age, from the greater inventor of human sovereignty,
Satoshi Nakamoto.

## Conclusion
All financial information systems built based on fiat money, centralization and are not permissionless
have one goal in common, profits to the elite few at the expense of everyone's freedom to transact. 
By proof of work, Bitcoin has value from the energy spent on mining. By distributing transaction history and being peer to peer and
permissionless, Bitcoin is the most secure <b>Freedom to Transact</b> technology that any sane human being could dream of, and we should
be proud to have it in our age.
